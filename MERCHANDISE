We are now accepting orders for ratpoison patches!

The patch is the red and black ratpoison logo [1] screen printed onto
a piece of scrap fabric approximately 15 cm^2.  They are hand printed
by the ratpoison developers.

If you specify the colours that you would like the fabric, rat, and
circle-line to be, we will do our best to match them with the
materials we have on hand.

The price is $2.00 (CDN or USD) per patch, plus postage [2].

Send cheque or money order cashable in Canadian or US funds to:
