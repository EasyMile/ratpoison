* Bugs
** Multiple screens, multiheaded x server, is busted.

* Misc
Flip a bit when an X error occurs and display it in the main event
loop (events.c:get_event) to avoid an infinite loop.

* command stuff

** general argument parsing strategy
Its a free for all right now.

** return the current setting for the def* command suite
When in non-interactive mode, so scripts that need to change them can
change them back when they're done. Low priority.

* implement these screen commands (see the screen info for documentation):
command ???
hardcopy (screenshot)
license
lockscreen
msgminwait
nethack
redisplay
screen (ratpoison)
shell
shelltitle
sleep
sorendition
stuff ???
