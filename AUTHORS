Shawn Betts (sabetts@mail.sourceforge.net)

Shawn is the original author and current maintainer for
ratpoison. Sickened by the rat and the trend in window managers, he
sat down one evening and pulled an all-nighter writing the first
version of ratpoison.

Ryan Yeske (rcyeske@vcn.bc.ca)

Ryan began hacking on ratpoison so he could ssh his university
by only pressing 3 keys.  He also thinks that a keyboard driven window
manager is the optimal user interface for penbased handheld computers.
