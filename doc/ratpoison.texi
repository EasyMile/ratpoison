@chapter About

ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with no fat library dependencies,
no fancy graphics, no window decorations, and no flashy wank. It is
largely modelled after GNU Screen which has done wonders in virtual
terminal market.

All interaction with the window manager is done through
keystrokes. ratpoison has a prefix map to minimize the key clobbering
that cripples EMACS and other quality pieces of software.

You'll also be pleased to hear that there is NO ratpoison.conf to
configure. If you want to configure ratpoison, edit the source.

@chapter Keystrokes

ratpoison is a very simple window manager. Each window is maximized and
has no border decorations. The default keystrokes are listed in the next
chapter, however, there are some which are bound to complex commands.
These are listed below:

@table @kbd

@item C-t c
This opens a new XTerm.

@item C-t e
This opens a new EMACS session. You will probably only need to do this
once.

@item C-t t
Sometimes you need to send a C-t to the current window. This keystroke
does just that.

@item C-t :
Enter a command line.

@chapter Ratpoison commands

Ratpoison can be controlled with commands (so called colon-commands).
The summary of available commands is listed below:

@table @command

@item abort
This is a pretty useless command. By default, it is bound to
@kbd{C-t g}, and its purpose is to abort other commands.

@item clock
Show current time. Disappears after 5 seconds, like all other info bars.
In the default setup, the @kbd{C-t a} keystroke is bound to this command.

@item delete
This deletes the current window. You can access it with the @kbd{C-t k}
keystroke.

@item exec @var{command}
Execute a shell command. By default, @kbd{C-t !} does this.

@item kill
This destroys the current window. Normally you should only need to
use @command{delete}, but just incase you need to rip the heart out of a
misbehaving window this command should do the trick. Also available as
@kbd{C-t K}.

@item maximize
Maximize the current window, just like @kbd{C-t m} would do.

@item next
This jumps you to the next window in the window list. This one is
bound to three keystrokes, namely @kbd{C-t n}, @kbd{C-t space},
and @kbd{C-t enter}.

@item newwm @var{window-manager}
This is a bad-bad command. It kills ratpoison and revives that
ugly rodden! Yuck! Avoid!

@item number @var{n}
This jumps you to window @var{n} where @var{n} is the window number as
shown in the Program Bar. You can do the same trick with
@command{C-@var{n}} too.

@item other
This toggles between the current window and the last window. By
default, this is bound to @kbd{C-t C-t}.

@item prev
This jumps you to the previous window in the window list. By default,
this is bound to @kbd{C-t p}.

@item select @var{window-name}
Go to a window by name. A shourcut is @var{C-t '}.

@item title @var{title}
Rename the currently active window. This name will remain for the
duration of the window's life, unless you change it again. By default,
the @kbd{C-t A} keystroke is bound to this command.

@item version
Print ratpoison version. @kbd{C-t v}! @kbd{C-t v}!

@item windows
This displays the Program Bar which displays the windows you currently
have running. The number before each window name is used to jump to that
window. You can do this by typing @kbd{C-t C-@var{n}} where @var{n} is the
number of the window. Note that only windows with numbers from 0 to 9
can be referenced.

After 5 seconds the Program Bar disappears.

This command is bound to @kbd{C-t w}.

@end table
