Ratpoison - Say good-bye to the rodent
--------------------------------------

About
-----

ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with no fat library dependencies,
no fancy graphics, no window decorations, and no flashy wank. It is
largely modelled after GNU Screen which has done wonders in virtual
terminal market.

All interaction with the window manager is done through
keystrokes. ratpoison has a prefix map to minimize the key clobbering
that cripples EMACS and other quality pieces of software.

You'll also be pleased to hear that there is NO ratpoison.conf to
configure. If you want to configure ratpoison, edit the source.

Building
--------

ratpoison comes with a Makefile that should work in most cases on most
architectures. If you have trouble compiling you may have to edit it.

The first thing to do is compile the beast by typing 'make':

$ make
gcc -c -g -Wall -I/usr/X11R6/include  -DDEBUG main.c -o main.o
gcc -c -g -Wall -I/usr/X11R6/include  -DDEBUG events.c -o events.o
gcc -c -g -Wall -I/usr/X11R6/include  -DDEBUG manage.c -o manage.o
gcc -c -g -Wall -I/usr/X11R6/include  -DDEBUG list.c -o list.o
gcc -c -g -Wall -I/usr/X11R6/include  -DDEBUG bar.c -o bar.o
gcc main.o events.o manage.o list.o bar.o -o ratpoison -g -Wall -I/usr/X11R6/include  -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 


if you want to install it, simply type 'make install' as a privileged user:

# make install
cp ratpoison /usr/local/bin

If you don't want ratpoison to install in /usr/local/bin, then edit
the Makefile.

Customization
-------------

By default, ratpoison is compiled using the rxvt terminal instead of
the default xterm.  Reasons?  For me (roam@orbitel.bg), xterm did not
want to start under FreeBSD's XFree86 4.0 port; besides, rxvt is WAY
better in many respects.

If you do want to use a different terminal program, edit conf.h and
edit the line:

#define TERM_PROG       "rxvt"	/* command to boot an xterm */

to run you're favorite xterm.
