ratpoison NEWS --- history of user-visible changes.  -*- outline -*-

* Changes since 1.0.0
** Remove command line options --kill and --restart
Use -c quit and -c restart instead.

** New command restart
Restart ratpoison.

** New command lastmsg
Display the last message.

** New command info
display information about the current window.

** New command unsetenv
Remove an environment variable from...well...the environment.

** New command chdir
Change the current directory.

** Multiple commands passed to ratpoison via the command-line are now processed
A stream of commands like, `ratpoison -c next -c prev -c next' are
processed in order.

** clock command renamed to time
This was to improve screen compatibility.

** New command setenv
Use this to set environment variables for all programs run from
ratpoison thereafter.

** Command defbartimeout renamed to msgwait
This was done to better mirror screen commands.

** Command generate renamed to meta
This was done to better mirror screen commands.

** Comand maximize renamed to redisplay
This was done to better mirror screen commands. It is no longer bound
to C-t m it is now bound to C-t l.

** Cursor in the input window
There is now a cheap cursor to help you remember where you are.

** conf.h compile-time customizations moved
They are now accessible through the def* suite of commands.

** Window alignment
Windows can now be aligned so they stick to the top-left corner of the
screen, the center of the screen, the bottom-right, etc. Use the `pos'
command. There is a customizable default setting for each of the three
'kinds' of windows: `defwinpos' for normal windows, `deftranspos' for
transient windows, and `defmaxsizepos' for normal windows with
maximimum size hints.

** Window format string
The format of the list of windows dumped by the `windows' command is
now customizable with `defwinfmt'.

** Different Window naming schemes
Windows now have 3 resources that can be used as their default name:
the WMNAME hint which generally contains transient information such as
what file is currently open, the res_name from the WMCLASS hint, or
the res_class the WMCLASS hint. This affects commands like `select'
which search for a window by name.

* Changes since 0.1.1

** new conf.h customization MAXSIZE_WINDOWS_ARE_TRANSIENTS
determines whether windows with maxsize hints are treated like
transient windows.

** The frame indicator
The frame indicator never sticks and only appears when there is more
than one frame (i.e. when there are splits).

** Transient window handling has changed
Transient windows now map ontop of the current window.

** new command 'rudeness'
This command allows you to fine tune what windows rp will map
when. For instance you can ask rp not to map new windows. Instead it
will notify you with a message: "New window #1 (emacs)".

** user abort key sequence
When typing input, hit C-g (customizable in conf.h) to abort the
input.

** new key syntax
keys are now specified with C-, M-, A-, H-, S- which stand for the
control, meta, alt, hyper, and super modifiers. ^ does not denote
control. Before, control t looked like ^t now it looks like C-t.

** new command 'help'
help brings up a key binding listing. it is bound to C-t ?.

** new command 'quit'
This command quits ratpoison

** windows not residing in a frame are hidden
This gets rid of annoying flickers around the edges of active windows
as windows in the back update.

** rat cursor changes

When you hit the prefix key the rat cursor changes to a square to tell
you what it is waiting for another key. This feature can be removed in
conf.h.

** Split windows

Well, the day is finally here. You can now split windows in
ratpoison. Hit C-t s to split horizontally and C-t S to split
vertically. Have fun!

** new command-line option --command

You can now send ratpoison commands (colon-commands) to ratpoison via
the command line. for example to tell ratpoison to go to the next
window type this:

$ ratpoison --command next

** window borders are configurable
WINDOW_BORDER_WIDTH has been added to conf.h. This constant determines
the border width for all windows.

** Rodent handling
A new command, :banish, which will move the rat pointer out of harms
way, has been added.  It is bound to 'C-t b' by default.  No more
slapping your rat out of the way, as fun as that was.

* Changes since 0.1.0

** Window list changes
A '+' is now drawn between the window number and the window name for
the last accessed window.

** AltGr (XK_Mode_switch) support

ratpoison now handles AltGr on all its input.

* Changes Since 0.0.5
** C-t e removed

Since you can custo your own keystrokes, there's not much sense
cluttering things with a binding to launch emacs.

** XErrorEvents don't bring down ratpoison

A friendly message pops up displaying the error message. This does
mean that there is a problem with ratpoison and it should be
investigated and reported. But at least your entire session doesn't go
down.

** Sorted window list

The window list is now sorted by number.

** Resizing input window

The size of the input window can be customized in conf.h by setting
INPUT_WINDOW_SIZE. It also dynamically resizes to accommodate the user
input.

** Pointer location

The pointer location is saved on a per window basis. When ratpoison
switches to a window it restores the pointer location to its location
the last time that window had focus.

** Auto quit ratpoison

When the auto close feature is enabled, ratpoison will exit when the
last managed window is closed. This feature can be turned on by
uncommenting the line:

/* #define AUTO_CLOSE */

in conf.h

** Improved shell command
The 'exec' command now calls execl ("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", cmd, 0)
where cmd is your shell command.  In short, you can now make shell
command calls with parameters.

The default keybinding has been changed from C-: to C-! for the 'exec'
command.

** Command line
An emulation of screen's colon command has been implemented.  This
allows you to make wm commands by name.  The current command set
includes: abort, next, prev, exec, select, colon, kill, delete, other,
windows, title, clock, maximize, newwm, and version.  To bring up a
command line prompt, type C-:.  See the info or man page for details
on the command set and its usage.

** Keysym reading updates
keystrokes are now handled far better. Shifted keystrokes work. More
uniform key event processing.

You can no longer "over modify" keys.  Previously, if C-tn was bound
to 'next', you could type C-tC-n and get the same result.  No longer.
You need to explicity map both C-tn and C-tC-n if you want both to
work.

** XSizeHints honoured
Windows may not maximize fully now since they use XSizeHints to figure
out how big the window can be.

** Bold color removed
ratpoison now uses only foreground and background colors.  They
default to black and white, respectively.  To represent the current
window in the bar, the current window's text is reversed.

** Colormap support
ratpoison now maintains colormaps

** New keystrokes
*** C-t space and C-t enter
Do the same as C-tn (next window)
*** C-tA
Shows a the time in the display bar
*** C-tv
Shows the version of ratpoison

** Messages in the window bar
ratpoison now outputs user error messages.

** Stability
All fixed length buffer sizes in window names that resulted in
curious segfaults have been fixed.

** Themes support
There is still no theme support, despite what you might have heard.


* Changes Singe 0.0.4
** added --kill and --restart
These command line options allow the restarting and killing of a
running ratpoison process.

** Mouse jumps to the bottom of the screen on keypresses
This is pretty annoying if you're using anything other than keyboard
apps. It is disabled by default.

This turns on debugging messages

** Added --version and --help command line options

asking you for the name of the window to jump to.
