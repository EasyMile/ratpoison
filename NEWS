ratpoison NEWS --- history of user-visible changes.  -*- outline -*-

* Changes Since 0.0.5
** Sorted window list

The window list is now sorted by number.

** Resizing input window

The size of the input window can be customized in conf.h by setting
INPUT_WINDOW_SIZE. It also dynamically resizes to accommodate the user
input.

** Pointer location

The pointer location is saved on a per window basis. When ratpoison
switches to a window it restores the pointer location to its location
the last time that window had focus.

** Auto quit ratpoison

When the auto close feature is enabled, ratpoison will exit when the
last managed window is closed. This feature can be turned on by
uncommenting the line:

//#define AUTO_CLOSE

in conf.h

** Improved shell command
The 'exec' command now calls execl ("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", cmd, 0)
where cmd is your shell command.  In short, you can now make shell
command calls with parameters.

The default keybinding has been changed from C-: to C-! for the 'exec'
command.

** Command line
An emulation of screen's colon command has been implemented.  This
allows you to make wm commands by name.  The current command set
includes: abort, next, prev, exec, number, select, colon, kill,
delete, other, windows, title, clock, maximize, newwm, and version.
To bring up a command line prompt, type C-:.  See the info or man page
for details on the command set and its usage.

** Keysym reading updates
keystrokes are now handled far better. Shifted keystrokes work. More
uniform key event processing.

You can no longer "over modify" keys.  Previously, if C-tn was bound
to 'next', you could type C-tC-n and get the same result.  No longer.
You need to explicity map both C-tn and C-tC-n if you want both to
work.

** XSizeHints honoured
Windows may not maximize fully now since they use XSizeHints to figure
out how big the window can be.

** Bold color removed
ratpoison now uses only foreground and background colors.  They
default to black and white, respectively.  To represent the current
window in the bar, the current window's text is reversed.

** Colormap support
ratpoison now maintains colormaps

** New keystrokes
*** C-t space and C-t enter
Do the same as C-tn (next window)
*** C-tA
Shows a the time in the display bar
*** C-tv
Shows the version of ratpoison

** Messages in the window bar
ratpoison now outputs user error messages.

** Stability
All fixed length buffer sizes in window names that resulted in
curious segfaults have been fixed.


* Changes Singe 0.0.4
** added --kill and --restart
These command line options allow the restarting and killing of a
running ratpoison process.

** Mouse jumps to the bottom of the screen on keypresses
This is pretty annoying if you're using anything other than keyboard
apps. It is disabled by default.

* Changes Since 0.0.3
** Added --enable-debug
This turns on debugging messages

** Added --version and --help command line options


* Changes Since 0.0.2
** Installation
*** Added automake and autoconf
To build and install ratpoison, you must now do this:

aclocal
automake -a -c
autoconf
./configure
make
make install

** Features
*** Added jump to window by name Hit C-t C-' and a box will pop up
asking you for the name of the window to jump to.

*** Added rename-window 
hit C-t C-a and a box will pop up asking you to rename the current
window. Once it has been renamed, it will stay renamed.

** Bugs and Bug fixes
