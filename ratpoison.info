About
*****

   ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with no fat library
dependencies, no fancy graphics, no window decorations, and no flashy
wank. It is largely modelled after GNU Screen which has done wonders in
virtual terminal market.

   All interaction with the window manager is done through keystrokes.
ratpoison has a prefix map to minimize the key clobbering that cripples
EMACS and other quality pieces of software.

   You'll also be pleased to hear that there is NO ratpoison.conf to
configure. If you want to configure ratpoison, edit the source.

Using ratpoison
***************

   ratpoison is a very simple window manager. Each window is maximized
and has no border decorations. Here is a list of commands and what they
do:

`C-t C-c'
     This opens a new XTerm.

`C-t C-e'
     This opens a new EMACS session. You will probably only need to do
     this once.

`C-t C-w'
     This displays the Program Bar which displays the windows you
     currently have running. The number before each window name is used
     to jump to that window. You can to this by typing `C-t C-<n>'
     where `<n>' is the number of the window. Note that only windows
     with numbers from 0 to 9 can be referenced.

     After 5 seconds the Program Bar disappears.

`C-t C-p'
     This jumps you to the previous window in the window list.

`C-t C-n'
     This jumps you to the next window in the window list.

`C-t C-<n>'
     This jumps you to window <n> where <n> is the window number as
     shown in the Program Bar.

`C-t C-t'
     This toggles between the current window and the last window.

`C-t t'
     Sometimes you need to send a C-t to the current window. This
     keystroke does just that.
