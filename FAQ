Ratpoison Frequently Asked Questions

* Conceptual Questions
** Where does the name `ratpoison' come from?

** Where are the window decorations?

** So, what is wrong with the mouse?

** Why can't I move the windows around?
There's no point.

* Usability & Customization Questions
** The Gimp is impossible to use under ratpoison!

** How do I bind a command to a single keystroke?
Pressing C-t is too much work for you, eh? There are plenty of 3rd
party programs that you can look into. xbindkeys seems to be a good
choice. Use ratpoison's -c command-line argument to send a command to
ratpoison.

** What about workspaces?
Windows can be divided into different groups. Each group of windows
has a number and optionally a name. With a bit of glue code, you can
create workspaces.

** Can I save and restore frame configurations?
Yes you can! Look at fdump and frestore.

** How do I get rid of that 1 pixel border around some of the windows?
Put this line in your .ratpoisonrc file:

defborder 0

** I want feature XYZ
What you want is probably already in Emacs. If you don't use Emacs,
start. If do use Emacs, use it more. If you *still* can't do what you
want to do, you probably shouldn't do it. 

If you're stubborn enough to keep trying, patch ratpoison and post the
patch on the mailing list. Don't forget to read the README.developers
file.
